## Systems Programming - Lecture 12

#### Lotsa Errors
1. Preprocessing: Text replacement & define namespaces
2. Compiling: Computer to assembly process
3. Assembling: Assemble
4. Linking: Refernce/link to libraries that are not apart of your source.

#### Static vs Dynamic Linking:
<b>Static Linking</b> resolved and addressed at compile time
<b>Dyanmic Linking</b> Linke to the program on access at runtime.
